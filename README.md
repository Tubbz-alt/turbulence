# What is Turbulence?

Turbulence is a utility similar to Chakra's kapudan, that
configures multiple aspects of Openbox and KDE Desktop at 
first boot. Some of it's features are:

* Sleak grey graphical layout
* Provides information of Manjaro to new users
* Provides process detection to better serve configuration options based on what you're running
* Can allow the user to easily select which Folders he wants in his home directory
* Allows users to select which placement for their tint2 (OpenBox)
* Allows users to select which wallpaper they want (Openbox/KDE)
* Allows users to select what packages they want and don't want (OpenBox only for now.)
* Can also allow people to open system settings after they've ran through everything else to set any last minute details
